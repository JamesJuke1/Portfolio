<p>You are 18 and for your summer break you decide to look at colleges. 
	One recruiter really stood out to you, so you decide to look at them first.
	 You always thought something was different about you, you just did not expect to ever have powers. 
	 You have just joined a world filled with supernatural of all kinds. 
	 First you must pass pledge week and decide what kind of supernatural being you are,
	  are you good or will evil lure you to the darkness, are you going to be an honor student, 
	  a jock or did you come just for the attractions? The choice and grades are up to you, but choice wisely as danger lurks around every corner in a school filled with supernatural and old blood feuds. </p>
